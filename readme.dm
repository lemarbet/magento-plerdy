Conversion Optimization Tools
To achieve the maximum level of conversion, you need to analyze a whole bunch of important statistics. It’s necessary to know traffic sources, scroll depth, understand which website elements users click the most often, and monitor usability. Based on this information you can develop an action plan to increase conversion rate.

Plerdy is designed to automatically collect all data that can show how to grow conversion. Users get access to a click heatmap and SEO alerts. With this tool, you can also create smart pop-up forms without the help of developers. Plerdy’s script takes only 30-40 seconds to add and doesn’t slow down websites.

What Do Plerdy Users Get?
The functionality of this service includes 4 components: a click heatmap, session recordings, pop-up forms, and SEO alerts.

Plerdy Heatmap
A click heatmap is a tool that shows how users behave when they visit a web page. This data reflects the most often clicked elements, scroll depth, popular parts of the page, and click sequence.

What makes Plerdy Heatmap unique:
Clicks are collected with 99% accuracy
Data is transferred to your dashboard in real-time and immediately becomes available for analysis
Statistics reflect clicks on pop-up forms, sliders, and other dynamic elements
Information on clicks is displayed directly on your website
The script filters out insignificant clicks (e.g., clicks on blind zones)
Statistics can be grouped by certain characteristics (e.g., If you choose device type, the statistics will separate clicks made on mobile devices and PCs) Using this map, you can find flaws in your website design, improve the overall usability, reduce bounce rate, and increase conversion rate.
Session Recordings
Session replay software is a user behavior analytics tool that records what people do on a website. With such videos, you can see how visitors navigate and replay their important decisions to notice every move and action.

Session Recordings can:
Record only specific pages based on settings
Show the real behavior of users in the video format
Replay separate sessions, pause, and fast-forward them
Capture videos of user behavior both on mobile and desktop devices
Segment millions of user sessions by custom parameters
Skip pauses to let you focus on the most important moments This Plerdy’s feature provides the most realistic picture of your customers’ conversion path. You can detect the obstacles they face to instantly eliminate them and improve conversion rates. Session replays also help to enhance customer experience and support.
Smart Pop-Up Forms
It’s an excellent tool to generate more leads, grow a contact base, and inform users about special offers or other events. Most importantly, you don't need the help of developers to add a smart form to your website.

SEO Checker
The position of a website in search results depends on dozens of SEO indicators. Plerdy SEO Checker doesn’t only monitor current indicators but also compares them with the previous data. Thanks to this, you can track how SEO indicators change over time.

Plerdy SEO Alerts:
Perform SEO audit and analyze web page semantics. The tool analyzes description, title, H1, the number of javascript files, H tags, "a" with "#" in href, style attributes in tags and body, and various other parameters
Automatically scans robots.txt files
Processes pages with noindex tag
Record information from different types of devices. Without such an analysis, you cannot understand why your website is so far from TOP search results. Its promotion will be hampered. The website will be less visited and the sales volume will stay the same.
